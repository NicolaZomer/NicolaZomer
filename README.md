### Ciao everyone! 👋

I am a Master's student in Physics of Data at the University of Padua. The Master’s degree provides new theoretical and computational tools to tackle the explosion of datasets within the physicist mindset. The program intends to build an academic and professional figure that combines advanced knowledge in the field of Physics with a high-level training in Data Science.

- 🎓 BSc in Aerospace Engineering
