### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a Master's student in Physics of Data at the University of Padua. The Masterâ€™s degree provides new theoretical and computational tools to tackle the explosion of datasets within the physicist mindset. The program intends to build an academic and professional figure that combines advanced knowledge in the field of Physics with a high-level training in Data Science.

First Year Courses:
- Laboratory of Computational Physics
- Management and Analysis of Physics Dataset
- Machine Learning
- Advanced Statistic for Physics Analysis (R programming)
- General Relativity
- Statistical Mechanics of Complex Systems
- Network Modelling (Stochastic Processes)

In my Github you can find the projects I'm developing during my studies. For more information you can visit my [personal website](https://nicolazomer.github.io/).
