### Ciao everyone! 👋

I am an incoming PhD student in applied data science and AI at [MWI](https://marine-weather.com/) and the [LMBA laboratory](http://www.lmba-math.fr/) in Vannes (France) as part of the [CIFRE program](https://www.anrt.asso.fr/fr/le-dispositif-cifre-7844). Every now and then I'll also be in Trieste (Italy) working with [Antonio Celani](https://www.ictp.it/member/antonio-celani#biography)! 

- 🎓 BSc in Aerospace Engineering
